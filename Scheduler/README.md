## Set up
1. Install all dependencies in scheduler.py


2. Make sure database is set up and api running


3. Queue should be filled and historic table empty


4. Simulation api should also be running


5. Adjust settings at the bottom of scheduler.py


6. Webinterface of database needs to be inactive
   (If unsure, restart the api)


7. Run scheduler.py

## Hints

It was not easy combining completely separately build components

and the simulation does not always work. (No choice but to try again) 

Fixed versions are not used everywhere, so future updates to

libraries might break the tool.
